**How to get started with your app :** 
<hr>

**Prerequisites**
1. Node js v12 or above should be installed
2. Github should be installed
3. Any IDE that supports Javascript should be installed

**Procedure of setting up prerequisites and run the project**
1. Open the IDE 
2. Clone the project using this link [https://github.com/arosh-segar/online-fashion.git](https://github.com/arosh-segar/online-fashion.git)
3. First you need to install the packages for both front end and back end
4. Open two terminals one for front end and back end
5. By default you will be in the front end directory therefore you can directly run **npm install** in the front end terminal
6. Next you need to switch to the back end directory in the back end terminal by giving the **cd Backend** command and then you can run the **npm install** to install the back end packages
7. Once all the packages are installed in both the front end and the backend you can then start the backend server by running **npm start**.
8. Once the backend server is started you can run the **npm start** command in the front end terminal to start the front end server. This will usually run the front end on port number 3000
9. Next you can open up any browser and type the following url http://localhost:3000 and this will load the web application
